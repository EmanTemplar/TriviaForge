## Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Docker** and **Docker Compose** (recommended)
  - OR Node.js (v20 or higher) + PostgreSQL 15

### Quick Start with Docker (Recommended)

> **Important**: TriviaForge requires **TWO containers** to run:
> 1. `triviagame-app` - The Node.js application (pulls from Docker Hub)
> 2. `triviagame-db` - PostgreSQL 15 database (pulls from Docker Hub)
>
> You **MUST** use docker-compose to start both containers together.

**Choose your preferred setup method:**

#### Option A: Command Line (Recommended)

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:EmanTemplar/TriviaForge.git
   cd TriviaForge
   ```

2. **⚠️ IMPORTANT: Configure environment variables BEFORE starting**

   Create your `.env` file from the template:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   **Now open the `.env` file in a text editor and configure these REQUIRED settings:**

   ```env
   # REQUIRED: Set your admin password (login won't work without this!)
   ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_secure_password_here

   # REQUIRED: Set your server IP for QR codes to work
   SERVER_URL=http://192.168.1.100:3000  # Replace with YOUR actual IP

   # Optional: Set your host IP (helps with network detection)
   HOST_IP=192.168.1.100  # Replace with YOUR actual IP
   ```

   Find your IP address:
   - **Windows**: Run `ipconfig` in Command Prompt (look for IPv4 Address)
   - **Mac/Linux**: Run `ifconfig` or `ip addr` in Terminal

   **Do not proceed until you've set `ADMIN_PASSWORD` and `SERVER_URL` in your .env file!**

3. **Start the application**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

   This will:
   - Pull `postgres:15` from Docker Hub
   - Pull `emancodetemplar/triviaforge:latest` from Docker Hub
   - Start the database and wait for it to be healthy
   - Initialize the database schema automatically (takes 30-60 seconds)
   - Start the application

4. **Verify startup**
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs -f app
   ```

   Wait for these success messages:
   - `✅ Database connection established`
   - `✅ Database initialization completed successfully`
   - `Server running on port 3000`

5. **Access the application**
   - Landing Page: `http://localhost:3000` (or use your SERVER_URL)
   - Admin Panel: `http://localhost:3000/index.html`
   - Use the ADMIN_PASSWORD you set in your .env file

#### Option B: Docker Desktop UI

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:EmanTemplar/TriviaForge.git
   cd TriviaForge
   ```

2. **⚠️ IMPORTANT: Configure .env file FIRST**

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   Open `.env` in a text editor and set at minimum:
   - `ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_secure_password`
   - `SERVER_URL=http://YOUR_IP:3000`
   - `HOST_IP=YOUR_IP`

   (See Option A step 2 for details)

3. **Start via Docker Desktop**
   - Open Docker Desktop
   - Open a terminal in the TriviaForge directory
   - Run: `docker-compose up -d`
   - OR drag the project folder into Docker Desktop (if supported)

4. **Monitor in Docker Desktop UI**
   - Go to **Containers** tab
   - You should see both containers running:
     - `triviagame-app`
     - `triviagame-db`
   - Click on `triviagame-app` to view logs
   - Wait for: `Server running on port 3000`

5. **Access the application**
   - Landing Page: `http://localhost:3000`
   - Use the ADMIN_PASSWORD from your .env file

#### Common Docker Commands

**View logs:**
```bash
docker-compose logs -f        # All services
docker-compose logs -f app    # Just the application
docker-compose logs -f db     # Just the database
```

**Stop the application:**
```bash
docker-compose down           # Stop and remove containers
docker-compose down -v        # Also remove database volume (fresh start)
```

**Restart after changes:**
```bash
docker-compose restart        # Restart existing containers
docker-compose up -d          # Recreate containers if needed
```

### Manual Setup (Without Docker)

1. **Install PostgreSQL 15**
   - Follow [PostgreSQL installation guide](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)

2. **Create database**
   ```bash
   createdb trivia
   psql trivia < app/init/tables.sql
   ```

3. **Install Node.js dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd app
   npm install
   ```

4. **Configure environment variables**

   Create `.env` file in `app` directory:
   ```env
   DATABASE_URL=postgres://your_user:your_password@localhost:5432/trivia
   ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_secure_password_here
   APP_PORT=3000
   ```

5. **Start the server**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Environment Variables

### Configuration Methods

Environment variables can be set in multiple ways (listed by precedence, highest to lowest):

1. **Docker Desktop UI** - Set directly in the container configuration (highest priority)
2. **`.env` file** - Place in the root directory alongside `docker-compose.yml`
3. **Default values** - Built into `docker-compose.yml` (lowest priority)

### Available Variables

| Variable | Description | Default | Required |
|----------|-------------|---------|----------|
| `APP_PORT` | Port number for the server | `3000` | No |
| `DATABASE_URL` | PostgreSQL connection string | `postgres://trivia:trivia@db:5432/trivia` | Yes (auto-configured in Docker) |
| `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | Password to access admin panel | - | **Yes** |
| `HOST_IP` | Server IP address for network access | Auto-detected | No |
| `SERVER_URL` | Full server URL (overrides HOST_IP) | - | **Yes** (for QR codes) |
| `SESSION_TIMEOUT` | Session expiration time (ms) | `3600000` (1 hour) | No |
| `NODE_ENV` | Environment mode (`development` or `production`) | `production` | No |
| `DEBUG_MODE` | Enable comprehensive debug logging (server-side) | `false` | No |
| `TZ` | Timezone for timestamps | `America/New_York` | No |
| `APP_NAME` | Application name | `TriviaForge` | No |

### Important Notes

- **For Docker Desktop users:** Variables set in the UI will override `.env` file values
- **For Docker Compose CLI users:** Create a `.env` file from `.env.example` and configure there
- **`ADMIN_PASSWORD`** must be set before first run for admin login to work
- **`SERVER_URL`** should be set to your server's accessible IP/hostname for QR code generation to work correctly
